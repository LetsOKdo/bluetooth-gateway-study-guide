# bluetooth-gateway-study-guide
My debugged version of the Python Bluetooth Internet Gateways Study Guide from Bluetooth SIG V2_0_1

This is a web BLE gateway based on an embedded HTTP server (Apache2) and WS (Websocketd)

I've been testing it on a ROCK-3C with Silicon Labs Thunderboard Sense (SLTB001A) & Thunderboard EFR32BG22 (SLTB010A)
